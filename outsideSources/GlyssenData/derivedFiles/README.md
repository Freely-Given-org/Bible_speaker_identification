# SIL Glyssen derived files

None of the other files in this folder have been hand-created.
They are all produced from their original xml and tsv files
by a script for convenience of those wanting to use the data.

Any errors in these files will need to be fixed either in the
original files, or in the _loadGlyssenData.py_ conversion script.

If you require a slightly different format or pivot of the data,
feel free to contact us and we might be able to help.
