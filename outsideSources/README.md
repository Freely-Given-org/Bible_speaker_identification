Freely-Given.org is taking open-licensed Bible names / speaker datasets,
checking, reprocessing, combining, and curating them into new forms.
We believe that we're doing this in line with the intent of the
original authors that their hard work be put to use in ways like this.
(If that's wrong, please do contact us.)

We expect that many Bible programmers will find the derived JSON
(and maybe even the XML) files easier to use than some of the
original formats.

At this stage, we are aware of three datasets which are available
to be used in this way:

- TIPNR spreadsheet from Tyndale House, Cambrdige
- exported tables from Theographic Bible Data from Viz.Bible
- various TSV and XML data files from SIL Glyssen

See the subfolders for more details of each.

Any work or effort that has been contributed by Freely-Given.org
processing these datasets is freely gifted to the world,
i.e, our curation work is released into the public domain.
(Please note that that does not at all imply that the
licence conditions of the original content creators no longer apply.)
