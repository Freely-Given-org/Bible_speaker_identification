# Theographic Bible Data tables

The original copy of these files came from a repository at https://airtable.com.
This is accessed by requesting permission as explained
at https://viz.bible/bible-data.
(This automatically subscribes you to their email "updates".)

Because permission has to be requested in this manner,
we are not committing the downloaded .csv files
to this repository.

Update: Oh, we found https://github.com/robertrouse/theographic-bible-metadata.
But it may not be as up-to-date as the AirTable DB???

Also found some interesting background at https://www.notion.so/theographic/About-Theographic-bb40cb93b1ac43bd98252abce225d530
and at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-f7dYKhCFWNg7Ijpshe9g.

We would like to express grateful thanks to Viz.Bible

hence we have not included it here either.)

## Notes

- Our first extraction had 66 books, 1,189 chapters, 31,102 verses,
3,069 people, 20 peopleGroups, 1,274 places, 250 periods, 391 events,
and 6,519 Easton dictionary entries.

## Format

The 'xxx-Grid view.csv' (where xxx is 'people', 'peopleGroups', etc.)
files contain the entire (unfiltered) tables.
As Theographic Bible Data is still a work-in-progress,
these may include unfinished entries.

## Our comments on the original Theographic Bible Data

This dataset tends to number all the entries in alphabetical order,
e.g., for people: from aaron_1 through to zurishaddai_3113.
These arbitrary numbers seem pointless to humans,
so we only append a numerical suffix when there's
multiple people/places with the identical name.
(And even then, we remove the suffix if one of those is a major/well-known one.)

It seems to us that versification is a separate issue from
people, places, events, etc. So we would not include most of the
books, chapters, verses data here (and Bible text).
However, it does seem useful
to note which books are written by which person and when.
We have no need for people count and place count by chapter,
as chapter divisions are often totally arbitrary.
Also some of that can be calculated or pivoted from the
verse reference data, so probably no need to be in the master
data files???
