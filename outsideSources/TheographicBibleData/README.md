# Theographic Bible Data tables

The original copy of these files came from a repository at https://airtable.com.
This is accessed by requesting permission as explained
at https://viz.bible/bible-data.
(This automatically subscribes you to their email "updates".)

Because permission has to be requested in this manner,
we are not committing the downloaded .csv files
to this repository.

Update: Oh, we found https://github.com/robertrouse/theographic-bible-metadata.
But it may not be as up-to-date as the AirTable DB???

Also found some interesting background at https://www.notion.so/theographic/About-Theographic-bb40cb93b1ac43bd98252abce225d530
and at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-f7dYKhCFWNg7Ijpshe9g.

Any work or effort that has been contributed by Freely-Given.org
processing these .csv tables is freely gifted to the world,

We would like to express grateful thanks to Viz.Bible
for this work, and especially to the main author and others
that contributed to make their work available under an open licence.
(The main author's name is not displayed on Viz.Bible as far as we could see,
hence we have not included it here either.)

## Notes

- Our first extraction had 66 books, 1,189 chapters, 31,102 verses,
3,069 people, 20 peopleGroups, 1,274 places, 250 periods, 391 events,
and 6,519 Easton dictionary entries.

## Format

The 'xxx-Grid view.csv' (where xxx is 'people', 'peopleGroups', etc.)
files contain the entire (unfiltered) tables.
As Theographic Bible Data is still a work-in-progress,
these may include unfinished entries.
