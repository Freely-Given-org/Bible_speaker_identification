# Theographic Bible Data derived files

None of the other files in this folder have been hand-created.
They are all produced from their original csv files
by a script for convenience of those wanting to use the data.

Any errors in these files will need to be fixed either in the
original table, or in the _loadTheographicBibleData.py_ conversion script.

If you require a slightly different format or pivot of the data,
feel free to contact us and we might be able to help.

## Notes

The "raw" files should have the same content as the source files.
The "mid" files are intermediate files (for debugging, etc.)
and probably of no use to anyone else
(and might eventually be removed from this repo).
The "normalised" files should have all the content from the sources
but with our own keys (FGid) and with other fields also
reformatted into more immediately useful data structures.
