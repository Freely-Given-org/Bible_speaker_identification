# Bible_speaker_identification

Reference data and algorithms for identifying speakers and quotations in Bible text

The Bible contains a range of direct and indirect speech, as well as quotations, narrator interrupts, implicit speech, etc. It can be useful to have these text snippets tagged with identifiers in order to allow the following:

1. Calculating the number of speakers required for an audio or video production.
2. Printing scripts for assigning speakers for an audio or video production.
3. Automatically linking to biographical details or other information in a Bible app.
4. Advanced searching capabilities.
5. Alginment of texts in multiple lanhguages for reference purposes, checking, and possible NLP applications.

We plan to use this repository firstly as a home for discussion, and then hopefully for the following:

1. Manually curated quotation data for Bible books
2. Standard formats for the above, and for marking-up Bible data, e.g., USFM files.
3. Derived forms of the data as required, e.g., JSON or other compiled versions of the source data
4. Algorithms and or code for automatically parsing and tagging of Bible files.
5. Possibly some marked-up sample Bibles (open-licensed of course).
